# MSIS Visualizer

The MSIS Visualizer provides a tool to interactively display the output from the [NRLMSIS](https://www.nrl.navy.mil/ssd/branches/7630/modeling-upper-atmosphere) model.

The [NRLMSIS](https://www.nrl.navy.mil/ssd/branches/7630/modeling-upper-atmosphere) code is developed at the Naval Research Laboratory. It is an empirical code to determine the temperature and density of species in the upper atmosphere.
